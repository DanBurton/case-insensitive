1.0  @  Mon Jan 28 14:39:05 UTC 2013

* Make package ready for the Haskell Platform

* Drop the UnicodeSyntax, TypeSynonymInstances and FlexibleInstances
  language extensions

* Add instance NFData s => NFData (CI s)

* Add a hidden method to the FoldCase type class:
    foldCaseList :: [s] -> [s]
    foldCaseList = L.map foldCase

* Add instance FoldCase a => FoldCase [a] where
        foldCase = foldCaseList

* Add instance FoldCase Char where
        foldCase     = toLower
        foldCaseList = TL.unpack . TL.toCaseFold . TL.pack

* Added a simple test suite

* Added a simple benchmark

* Added a rewrite rule to make 'mk' more efficient on strict
  ByteStrings
